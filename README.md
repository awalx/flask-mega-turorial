# flask-mega-turorial
The Flask Mega-Tutorial is an overarching tutorial for Python beginner and intermediate developers that teaches web development with the Flask framework. The tutorial was born as a series of blog articles, and has been thoroughly revised, updated and expanded as a result of a successful Kickstarter campaign. The concepts that are covered go well beyond Flask, including a wide range of topics Python web developers need to know when writing their own applications.

The goal of the course is to build a nicely featured social blogging web application. Chapter 1 begins with a very simple version of this application that has just a few lines of code. Then, each successive chapter adds a new feature to it. The 23 chapters in this course can be roughly split into two parts: the first 12 chapters are focused on basic web development concepts, while the remaining 11 chapters cover intermediate and advanced techniques. All the code featured in this tutorial is open source, and is available on GitHub. You are welcome to use any of it for your own projects!
